## Features

- Add/Remove Items from Cart: Browse through the catalog and add items to the cart. You can also remove items if you change your mind.
- Modify Item Quantities: Directly from the cart, you can increase or decrease the quantity of any item.
- Checkout Process: Proceed to checkout from the cart screen, select a payment method, and place your order. When the cart is empty, the checkout button is disabled, preventing proceeding to checkout with an empty cart.
- Order Completion: Once an order is completed, the cart is emptied, ready for your next shopping spree.

## Technical Details

- This project uses only the primary packages needed to build a React Native Expo app with the blank setup. No additional libraries are used, even for navigation. Instead, a custom navigation system based on React state was implemented to manage screen transitions within the app.
